# Stack Exchange Question Filters

These are [userscripts][] for cleaning up the question list on
[StackExchange][] sites.

## sx-hide-questions.user.js

This script will hide questions based on:

- Whether the question has been closed
- Whether the question has been marked as a duplicate
- Whether the question has been downvoted

Each class of filter can be individually enabled/disabled.

By default, questions fade out so you can see the magic happening.


## sx-reorder-questions.user.js

This script will reorder questions so that unanswered questions are on
top.
